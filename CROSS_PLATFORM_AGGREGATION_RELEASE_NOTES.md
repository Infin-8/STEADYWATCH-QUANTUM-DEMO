## 📖 Research Paper Details

**Title:** Cross-Platform Qubit Aggregation: Enabling Large-Scale Quantum Algorithms on Current Hardware

**Authors:** STEADYWATCH Research Team, Quantum V^ LLC

**Abstract:**
We present a novel approach to quantum computing that aggregates qubits across multiple quantum platforms (IBM Quantum and AWS Braket) to enable large-scale quantum algorithms that would otherwise be infeasible on any single platform. By combining 783 qubits across 5 quantum hardware platforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of Shor's algorithm for 250-bit RSA factorization (requiring 750 qubits) and Grover's algorithm for SHA-256 preimage search (requiring 258 qubits). Our hybrid classical-quantum distributed approach enables educational demonstrations and practical implementations of quantum algorithms that exceed the capacity of individual quantum platforms.

**Key Contributions:**
1. First cross-platform qubit aggregation system (783 qubits)
2. Feasibility demonstration for Shor's and Grover's algorithms
3. Hybrid classical-quantum distributed strategy
4. Practical implementation with platform discovery and allocation
