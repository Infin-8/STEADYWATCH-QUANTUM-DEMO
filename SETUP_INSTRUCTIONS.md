# Setup Instructions for Public Demo Repository

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `STEADYWATCH-QUANTUM-DEMO`
3. Description: "Public demo of Echo Resonance Technology quantum computing research for IBM Quantum Credits application"
4. Set to **Public**
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize and Push

```bash
cd STEADYWATCH-QUANTUM-DEMO

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial public demo - Echo Resonance Technology quantum computing research"

# Add remote (replace with your actual GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/GG-Studios-Tech/STEADYWATCH-QUANTUM-DEMO.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify

1. Check GitHub repository: https://github.com/GG-Studios-Tech/STEADYWATCH-QUANTUM-DEMO
2. Verify all files are present
3. Verify README.md displays correctly
4. Test that requirements.txt is accessible
